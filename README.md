# latin-1-table
because i am tired of suffering looking through online tables and having them all look like shit >:3

if you want to parse this, you will have to handle char `|` as a special case, and basically just 
array split at newlines and `|`; all lines starting with `#` should be ignored.

Except that it isn't finished yet.
